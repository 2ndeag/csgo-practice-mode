csgo-practice-mode
===========================

[![Build status](http://ci.splewis.net/job/csgo-practice-mode/badge/icon)](http://ci.splewis.net/job/csgo-practice-mode/)

Practice Mode is a sourcemod plugin for helping players/teams run practices. It was formerly a part of [PugSetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) but has since been made into a separate project. It still contains integrations with pugsetup to make it available on it's ``.setup`` menu. It is also still distributed in pugsetup's releases.

**Note**: access to the .setup requires having the sourcemod admin changemap flag ("g") by default.

See this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua_I30DTggQ) for a demonstration.

## Download

Download from [the releases section](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode/releases).

You may also download the [latest development build](http://ci.splewis.net/job/csgo-practice-mode/lastSuccessfulBuild/) if you wish. If you report any bugs from these, make sure to include the build number (when typing ``sm plugins list`` into the server console, the build number will be displayed with the plugin version).

### Installation

Extract the files in the release archive to the ``csgo`` server directory.

You must have [SourceMod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php) and [MetaMod:Source](http://www.sourcemm.net/downloads) installed to use this plugin.

## Features
- Draws working grenade trajectories if ``sv_grenade_trajectory`` is on (since it doesn't work on dedicated servers)
- Adds new cvars to give extra practice settings (infinite money, noclip without needing sv_cheats enabled)
- Can save users' grenade locations/eye-angles with a name and description for them (grenade data is saved to a file on the server in the ``addons/sourcemod/data/practicemode/grenades`` directory)
- Users can goto any players' saved grenades to learn or revisit them
- Displays a menu with toggle settings to set practice cvars defined in [addons/sourcemod/configs/practicemode.cfg](configs/practicemode.cfg)
- Maintains your grenade history on the current map so you can use ``.back`` and ``.forward`` to see all spots you threw grenades from in the current session

### Commands
